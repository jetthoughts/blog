I am not a linux hacker, so I wasted a lot of time to find solution to strip first lines from output stream. First my solution was:

    :::sh
    tail -f some_file | ruby -e 'a =0; while t=gets; a+=1; puts t if a > 1; end'

It is looks very long, and I thought that this problem is very popular, and at least one tool already exist in the world.

I knew a tool __sed__ and used it before. So read the manual and wuala:

    :::sh
    tail -f some_file | sed "1d"

It do the same as first solution, but more clear and simple. __sed__ is a great tool.
